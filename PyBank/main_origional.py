# When I originally completed this assignment, I did it in Jupyter Notebook but had all my code in a single cell. 
# I eventually realized that this wasnâ€™t optimal and corrected my work accordingly.
# However, I wanted to keep a copy of my original work and decided to save it as a separate python file.
